- **Typography**: Consistent heading and body text styles
- **Icons**: Lucide-react for all icons
- **Responsive**: Grid layouts adapt to screen sizes
- **Status Colors**: Green (positive), red (negative), amber (warnings)

### 7. **Data Visualization** âœ…
- **Recharts** integration for line charts
- **Custom Gauges** for system health metrics
- **Progress Bars** for research, quests, and reputation
- **Trend Indicators** for financial metrics

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
- All routing configured and working
- All 7 main game views implemented
- Landing page with marketing content
- State management structure ready
- Reusable component library
- Design system consistently applied
- Mock data demonstrates all features
- Development server running successfully

### ðŸ”„ Ready for Integration
- WebSocket client structure prepared in store
- API call patterns established (ready to replace mock data)
- Optimistic update patterns in place
- Real-time tick update handlers ready

## How to Run

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`

## Next Steps (Phase 3 & 5)

### Phase 3: Backend Development
1. Update Prisma schema with game models
2. Implement tick engine (5-second intervals)
3. Create REST API controllers
4. Set up WebSocket server for real-time updates
5. Implement authentication and authorization

### Phase 5: Integration
1. Connect frontend to backend REST APIs
2. Implement WebSocket client for tick updates
3. Replace all mock data with real API calls
4. Add authentication flow (login/register pages)
5. Implement protected route wrapper
6. Add error handling and loading states
7. Test all user flows end-to-end

## Mock Data Notes

All views currently use mock data to demonstrate functionality:
- Mock user and company data in store
- Mock sites with realistic metrics
- Mock market positions and prices
- Mock research tree with progress
- Mock governance proposals and reputation
- Mock quests with various states

This mock data structure matches the expected backend API shape, making integration straightforward.

## Design Highlights

- **Techno-Industrial Theme**: Dark backgrounds with neon accents
- **Real-Time Focus**: Header shows live tick data (BTC price, difficulty, hashrate)
- **Information Density**: Dashboards pack relevant metrics without clutter
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded health, margin, and alert states
- **Responsive Grids**: Adapt from 1-4 columns based on screen size
- **Glass Effects**: Subtle backdrop blur for depth
- **Consistent Spacing**: 4px/8px/16px/24px rhythm throughout
