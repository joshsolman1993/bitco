# Bug Fixes: WebSocket & Header Issues

## Issues Identified

### 1. Header Component Crash
**Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLocaleString')`
**Location**: `Header.tsx:58`
**Cause**: The `company` object was `null` on initial load, but the code tried to access `company.balance.toLocaleString()` without proper null checking.

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed `{company && (...)}` to `{company ? (...) : null}` for better type narrowing
- Added fallback values: `(company.balance || 0).toLocaleString()`
- Applied same pattern to `btcBalance` and `reputation` fields

### 2. WebSocket Unknown Message Types
**Error**: `[WS] Unknown message type: connected` and `[WS] Unknown message type: auth_error`
**Location**: `websocket.ts:173`
**Cause**: Backend sends `connected` and `auth_error` message types that weren't handled by the frontend.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `case 'connected'` handler to acknowledge server connection
- Added `case 'auth_error'` handler to display authentication errors to user
- Both cases now log appropriately and show alerts when needed

### 3. WebSocket Message Structure Mismatch
**Error**: WebSocket authentication failing silently
**Cause**: Backend expects messages with `{ type, data }` structure, but frontend was sending `{ type, payload }`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `send()` method to use `data` field instead of `payload`
- Updated `handleMessage()` to normalize both `data` and `payload` fields: `const payload = message.payload || message.data`
- This ensures compatibility with backend's message format

### 4. Dashboard Alert Signature
**Error**: TypeScript type mismatch in `addAlert()` call
**Cause**: Dashboard was passing `id` and wrong `type` value to `addAlert()`

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed `id` field (auto-generated by store)
- Changed `type: 'error'` to `type: 'critical'`
- Changed `timestamp: Date.now()` to `timestamp: new Date()`

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/components/Layout/Header.tsx**
   - Added null safety for company balance display
   - Changed conditional rendering pattern

2. **frontend/src/services/websocket.ts**
   - Added handlers for `connected` and `auth_error` message types
   - Fixed message structure to use `data` field for backend compatibility
   - Added payload normalization for incoming messages

3. **frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx**
   - Fixed `addAlert()` call signature

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test WebSocket Connection**:
   - Open browser console
   - Should see: `[WS] Connected` → `[WS] Connection acknowledged by server` → `[WS] Authentication successful`
   - No more "Unknown message type" warnings

2. **Test Header Display**:
   - Navigate to any protected route (Dashboard, Sites, etc.)
   - Header should display company balance, BTC balance, and reputation
   - No console errors about `toLocaleString`

3. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - Logout and login again
   - WebSocket should reconnect and authenticate
   - Check for any auth_error messages

## Expected Console Output (Success)

```
[WS] Connecting to ws://localhost:3000/ws
[WS] Connected
[WS] Message received: connected
[WS] Connection acknowledged by server
[WS] Message received: auth_success
[WS] Authentication successful
[WS] Message received: tick:update
```

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check backend WebSocket server is running on port 3000
2. Verify JWT token is valid and not expired
3. Check CORS settings allow WebSocket connections
4. Verify tick engine is broadcasting tick updates
